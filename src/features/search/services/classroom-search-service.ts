 * The richer, classroom-only search (Phase 15.2) - supports any combination
 * of a name/code text query, a teacher name/email query, and a status
 * filter (including "just Archived classrooms" with no text query at all).
 * Reuses getClassroomSearchScope (the same authorization primitive the
 * generic search() pipeline uses) so the role rules stay identical:
 * Students only see classrooms they've joined, Teachers only see classrooms
 * they manage or belong to, Admins see every classroom platform-wide.
 * Archived classrooms are included by default (scope already covers them) -
 * they only disappear if the caller explicitly filters status to Active.
