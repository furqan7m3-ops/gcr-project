 * The single entry point every calendar view (month/week/day) goes through.
 * It knows nothing about assignments, announcements, or any other concrete
 * content type - it only fans out to whatever providers have registered
 * themselves (see calendar-providers.ts and services/providers/), then
 * merges/filters/sorts the result. A future provider needs no changes here
 * or in any view component - just register itself and its events start
 * showing up.
 *
 * `scope` is computed once by the caller (see queries/calendar-queries.ts)
 * and passed in rather than derived here - the same scope is reused across
 * every provider's query and, when the /calendar page needs events for
 * several ranges at once (grid + today + upcoming + monthly agenda), across
 * every one of those calls too, instead of each independently re-querying
 * classroom membership (Phase 16.4).
